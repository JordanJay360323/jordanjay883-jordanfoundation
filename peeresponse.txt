From your page it was hard to figure out to which foundation you are referring.  I figured out it was “The Brian Jordan Foundation”.  I might suggest using the full name in the text for your link and building in the actual web site link to promote the cause. (<a href=“https://www.brianjordanfoundation.com/about-brian-jordan.htmlLinks to an external site.” target=_blank>The Brian Jordan Foundation</a>)
I recommend that you make two additional copies of your index.html page and title each to indicate what your additional two pages would be (“about.html” and “world_goals.html” for instance?) Then you change the <title> text to reflect the proper page for each page, and then implement a consistent navigation bar that allows you to go from any one page to any other page and back using the navigation bar.  After that you could work on the individual pages.
